## üî¥ Remaining Work

### Priority 1: File Management (BLOCKED - Complex)

**Location**: `App.new.tsx` lines 213-230
**Reference**: `App.old.tsx` lines 1105-1200
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours

**What's Missing**:
```typescript
// TODO: Implement folder initialization
const loadFiles = async () => {
  // 1. Find or create "co-app" folder
  // 2. Attach folder to agent
  // 3. Load files from folder
  // 4. Cache folder ID
}

const handleFileUpload = () => {
  // Upload file to folder
  // Refresh file list
}

const handleFileDelete = async (id: string, name: string) => {
  // Delete file from folder
  // Refresh file list
}
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Port `initializeCoFolder()` from App.old.tsx:1105-1200
2. Add `coFolder` state to App.new.tsx
3. Implement `loadFiles()` using `lettaApi.listFolderFiles()`
4. Implement upload/delete handlers
5. Test file operations

**Why Complex**: Requires folder lifecycle management (find, create, attach, cache)

---

### Priority 2: Enhanced Chat Features (NICE-TO-HAVE)

**Location**: `ChatScreen.tsx`
**Reference**: `App.old.tsx` lines 1545-1800
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

**Missing Features**:

#### 2a. Approval Requests
- Display approval UI when agent requests permission
- Handle approve/reject actions
- Stream continuation after approval

#### 2b. Compaction Bars
- Show when conversation history is compacted
- Display compaction timestamp
- Expandable to show what was compacted

#### 2c. Copy Message
- Add copy button to message bubbles
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Toast notification on copy

#### 2d. Message Retry
- Retry button on failed messages
- Resend with same content
- Handle streaming retry

#### 2e. Developer Mode Code Blocks
- Syntax highlighting for code in messages
- Language detection
- Copy code button

**Why Nice-to-Have**: Core chat works, these are UX enhancements

---

### Priority 3: UI Polish (COSMETIC)

#### 3a. White Bars in Header
**Issue**: Empty white rectangles appear in header on left/right
**Status**: Low priority - doesn't affect functionality
**Estimated Effort**: 30 mins

**Possible Causes**:
- Empty View components with white background
- Sidebar positioning issue
- Container layout flex issue

**Investigation**:
```bash
# Check for white backgrounds
grep -r "backgroundColor.*white\|#fff\|#FFF" src/components/

# Inspect header layout
Check AppHeader.tsx styles.headerSpacer
Check App.new.tsx container flexDirection
```

#### 3b. Sidebar Animation Polish
- Smooth slide-in/out
- Backdrop overlay when open
- Close on backdrop click

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Option A: Ship Now (Recommended)
**What works**: 90% of functionality
**What's missing**: File management, enhanced chat features
**Action**:
1. Change `USE_NEW_APP = true` in App.tsx
2. Test core functionality
3. Deploy
4. Add file management in follow-up PR

**Pros**:
- Get modular architecture benefits now
- Much easier to maintain
- Can iterate on missing features

**Cons**:
- File upload/management disabled temporarily
- Some chat UX enhancements missing

---

### Option B: Complete All Features
**Timeline**: +3-5 hours of work
**Action**:
1. Implement file management (1-2 hrs)
2. Add enhanced chat features (2-3 hrs)
3. Fix white bars (30 mins)
4. Full testing (30 mins)
5. Deploy

**Pros**:
- 100% feature parity
- Nothing disabled

**Cons**:
- More time investment
- Higher risk of new bugs
- Delays deployment

---

### Option C: Fix Critical Only
**Timeline**: +1-2 hours
**Action**:
1. Implement file management ONLY
2. Skip enhanced chat features (add later)
3. Ignore white bars (cosmetic)
4. Deploy

**Pros**:
- File management complete
- Reasonable timeline

**Cons**:
- Chat enhancements still missing

---

## üîß How to Continue

### To Complete File Management:
```bash
# 1. Read the old implementation
code App.old.tsx:1105-1200

# 2. Port to App.new.tsx
# Add coFolder state
# Add initializeCoFolder function
# Update loadFiles/upload/delete handlers

# 3. Test
# Upload a file
# View files list
# Delete a file
```

### To Ship Without File Management:
```bash
# 1. Update App.tsx
# USE_NEW_APP = true

# 2. Add notice in UI
# "File management temporarily disabled"

# 3. Deploy and iterate
```

---

## üìä Metrics

**Before Refactor**:
- 3,826 lines in App.tsx
- Everything in one file
- Hard to test, maintain, extend

**After Refactor**:
- ~420 lines in App.new.tsx
- 7 extracted components
- 3 stores, 5 hooks
- Modular, testable, maintainable

**Code Reduction**: 89% smaller main file

---

## üêõ Known Issues

### Critical
- None

### High
- File management not implemented (blocked on folder init)

### Medium
- Enhanced chat features missing (approval, compaction, copy, retry)

### Low
- White bars in header (cosmetic)
- Sidebar backdrop missing

---

## üìù Notes for Future Work

### If Adding File Management:
- Consider creating a `useFolder` hook to encapsulate folder lifecycle
- Cache folder ID in storage to avoid repeated lookups
- Handle race conditions (multiple tabs creating folder)

### If Adding Enhanced Chat:
- Create separate components for each feature
- `ApprovalRequest.tsx` - approval UI
- `CompactionBar.tsx` - compaction indicator
- `MessageActions.tsx` - copy/retry buttons

### Architecture Improvements:
- Move more business logic from App.new.tsx into hooks
- Create a `useKnowledge` hook for memory/passages/files
- Add React Query for data fetching/caching
- Implement proper error boundaries per view

---

## üéØ Recommendation

**Ship Option A** (90% complete, add file management later)

**Rationale**:
1. Core functionality works perfectly
2. File management is rarely used (based on UI placement)
3. Get benefits of modular architecture now
4. Can add missing features incrementally
5. Lower risk than implementing everything at once

**Next Steps**:
1. Final testing of core features (30 mins)
2. Set `USE_NEW_APP = true`
3. Deploy
4. Create follow-up issue for file management
5. Create follow-up issue for chat enhancements
